I'm a seasoned, tech-savvy journalist with business experience and a passionate interest in interactive media and marketing. I am currently Research Director for Third Door Media's Content Studio, where I'm responsible for producing our Martech Intelligence Reports, among other things. Here's an animation I wrote and created to explain what MIRs are all about.

Formerly, I was senior editor/projects manager, content manager (and, before that, executive features editor) at [Marketing Land](https://marketingland.com/), at [MarTech Today](https://martechtoday.com/) and at [Search Engine Land](https://searchengineland.com/) writing and editing content about search marketing and related topics, including display advertising, local and mobile.

Prior to joining [Third Door Media](https://thirddoormedia.com/), I worked for five years in community and business development at Federated Media Publishing managing partnerships with independent publishers. While at FM, I forged relationships with well-known bloggers in many verticals, working most closely with those in the Parenting and Small Business categories. (FM is now known as [sovrn media holdings](http://www.sovrn.net/).)

Prior to my time at Federated Media, I covered the interactive marketing business -- encompassing everything from search to e-mail to display to blogging -- as a journalist for ClickZ. I wrote about the then-burgeoning New York Internet start-up scene for @NY from 1998 to 1999, and have also worked as a general-assignment and medical reporter for KTRH NewsRadio in Houston, TX.

I started my professional career as Radio Station Manager at Taping for the Blind in Houston, after earning a degree in Radio-Television-Film at the University of Texas at Austin in 1989. I capped off my educational credentials in 1998 with a master's in journalism from Columbia University in New York City.

On the personal side, I'm married with two kids and also write a personal blog about kitchen gardening called Free Range. I have a media, marketing, technology blog I update occasionally called The River. In recent years, I've lived in NYC and the SF Bay Area, but currently, I reside in the Austin, Texas area.
